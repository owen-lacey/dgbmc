# Project Constitution

## Context
This is a personal side project with:
- **Users**: None (personal exploration)
- **Team**: Solo developer
- **Purpose**: Learning, experimentation, and creative freedom

## Core Principles

### 1. **Optimize for Learning, Not Production**
- Experiment freely with new technologies and approaches
- It's okay to have rough edges, incomplete features, and exploratory code
- Value gained knowledge over polished deliverables

### 2. **Move Fast and Keep It Simple**
- No formal processes, reviews, or approval gates
- Choose simple solutions over complex architectures
- Skip documentation that doesn't serve your future self
- Iterate rapidly rather than plan everything upfront (agile over waterfall)

### 3. **Follow Your Curiosity**
- Pivot direction whenever something more interesting appears
- Don't feel obligated to "finish" features
- It's fine to have multiple half-baked experiments coexisting

### 4. **No Premature Optimization**
- Don't build for scale that will never come
- Skip error handling for edge cases you'll never hit
- Performance tuning only when it actually bothers you

### 5. **Quick and Dirty When Appropriate**
- Copy-paste code if it's faster than abstracting
- Hardcode values that don't need to be configurable
- Use TODO comments liberally without guilt

### 6. **Code for Future You**
- Add comments when doing something non-obvious
- Use meaningful variable names even when alone
- Keep a simple notes file for context and ideas

### 7. **Version Control is Your Friend**
- Commit often, even if commits are messy
- Don't worry about perfect commit messages
- Use branches to try risky experiments without fear

### 8. **Dependencies are Cheap**
- Use libraries freely to avoid reinventing wheels
- Don't worry about bundle size or dependency count
- Pick tools you want to learn, not "best practices"

### 9. **Have Fun or Stop**
- If it stops being enjoyable, pause or pivot
- No deadlines, no pressure, no obligations
- The project serves you, not the other way around

### 10. **Shipping is Optional**
- It's fine to never deploy or share this
- Completion is not the goal
- Value the journey over the destination

## Anti-Principles (Things to Avoid)

- ❌ Don't add testing infrastructure until you actually need it
- ❌ Don't create documentation for imaginary future contributors
- ❌ Don't follow "best practices" that slow you down
- ❌ Don't feel guilty about abandoned experiments
- ❌ Don't optimize for maintainability beyond 6 months
- ❌ Don't build features for users that don't exist

## When to Break These Rules

These principles serve exploration and learning. Break them whenever:
- You're trying to learn "proper" software engineering
- The project naturally evolves toward having users
- You find yourself actually wanting more structure
- Following a principle makes things less fun

Remember: **This is your playground. The rules are yours to make and break.**
